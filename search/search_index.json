Based on identified the shortcomings of SG, I designed <code>Chao Recruit (CR)</code> PCB to be of the same footprint and yet accomodate for more demanding Input/ Output (IO). The main improvements over SG are the protected inputs (ESD &amp; Overvoltage) and MOSFET driven outputs.</p>"},{"location":"ChaoRecruit/#references","title":"References","text":""},{"location":"downloads/","title":"Downloads","text":""},{"location":"downloads/#3d-model","title":"3D Model","text":"<p>Download</p>"},{"location":"downloads/#technical-documentation","title":"Technical Documentation","text":"<p>Download</p>"},{"location":"help/","title":"Welcome to MkDocs","text":"<p>For full documentation visit mkdocs.org.</p>"},{"location":"help/#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>mkdocs serve</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>mkdocs build</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>mkdocs -h</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"help/#project-layout","title":"Project layout","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.\ndocs/\n    index.md  # The documentation homepage.\n    ...       # Other markdown pages, images and other files.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"schematics/","title":"Schematic Diagrams","text":""}]}
