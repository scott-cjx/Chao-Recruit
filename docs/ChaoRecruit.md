# Chao Recruit Documentation

## Abstract

This board was designed to replace NVF's `Small General (SG)` PCB. Based on identified the shortcomings of SG, I designed `Chao Recruit (CR)` PCB to be of the same footprint and yet accomodate for more demanding Input/ Output (IO). The main improvements over SG are the protected inputs (ESD & Overvoltage) and MOSFET driven outputs.
